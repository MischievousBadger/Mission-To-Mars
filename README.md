# Mission-To-Mars

The purpose of this project is to create a web app that scrapes the latest news article and daily image from NASA's Mars website, as well as pulling Mars facts and images of Mars' hemispheres.  This app was created using Python, Beautiful Soup, Splinter, Flask, MongoDB and Jupyter Notebook, as well as Bootstrap, HTML and CSS to add more polish to the app.
